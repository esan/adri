# This file is sourced from the linux-restricted-modules-common init
# script and is used to disable the link-on-boot feature, one module
# at a time.  This can be useful if you want to use hand-compiled
# versions of one or more modules, but keep linux-restricted-modules
# installed on your system, or just to disable modules you don't use
# and speed up your boot process by a second or two.
#
# Use a space-separated list of modules you wish to not have linked
# on boot.  The following example shows a (condensed) list of all
# modules shipped in the linux-restricted-modules packages:
#
# DISABLED_MODULES="madwifi ltm wl"
#
# Note that disabling "madwifi" disables all madwifi drivers, "ltm"
# disables ltmodem and ltserial. You can also name each module
# individually, if you prefer a subset.

DISABLED_MODULES=""
